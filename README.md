# marksgeneticsoftware
Location for older computer programs that I developed long ago and distributed from www.marksgeneticsoftware.net. I am in the process of decommissioning that site and will distribute from here. Original source code will follow after I dig up the old hard drives that the code resides upon!

For the time being, find old released code here: https://github.com/markperrymiller/markperrymiller.github.io/releases/tag/1
